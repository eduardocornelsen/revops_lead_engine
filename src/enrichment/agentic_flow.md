In the past 30 days Alex Hormozi has shared three notable LinkedIn posts: a motivational “You can beat 99 % of your competition in 2026” guide that emphasizes early showing, night‑before preparation, remembering names, saying “no” to low‑value opportunities, rapid and repeated follow‑ups, delivering consistent value, and avoiding repeated mistakes; an “I sold my last company for $46,200,000” reflection that outlines eight 2026‑focused lessons—including selling first to rich customers, prioritizing over information, raising team standards, minimizing restrictive rules, prioritizing quality over size, protecting focus from distractions, building a long‑term brand, and mastering the granular inputs and outputs of a money‑making system; and an “If you want to live an exceptional year in 2026, then you can’t” post warning that success requires new actions, a changed lifestyle, and higher standards rather than repeating the status‑quo.
